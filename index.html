  In this study, the proportion of infants infants 28 weeks with a proven symptomatic PDA was 49.9% in 2013–2015, with 39.9% in symptomatic treatment group and 10.0% in conservative treatment group in the KNN database. In previous results with the KNN in January 2013 - June 2014, NI was more preferred than PST or ST in infants with lower GA and birthweight, which suggests that quite a number of centers in Korea now favor conservative treatment.(7)</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Also in our results, NI group has a significantly lower GA and birthweight compared with symptomatic treatment group. Currently, many Korean neonatologists prefer supportive therapy alone in infants who appear to tolerate PDA awaiting spontaneous closure, in spite of no clear evidence of benefits in neonatal outcomes and potential side effects. Despite the lack of evidence from randomized clinical trials evaluating conservative treatment for symptomatic PDA in preterm neonates, 20% of very preterm neonates with symptomatic PDA in Korean NICUs included in this study received conservative treatment.</p>
